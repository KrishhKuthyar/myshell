This is a simple c program for the project 1, COP5570.
The myshell.cpp will realize the simple functions in bash shell.


You should type "make" to compile the .cpp files to get the execute files of myshell and myls.
You can type "make clean" to clean up the files.

*****myshell*****
If you type the ./myshell to run the shell program. 
1. Build-in commands:
a. mycd <path_name>--change your path to a nwe path, like: cd ..
b. mypwd--show your local dictionary path name
c. myexit--exit my shell
d. mytree [dir]--show the path in a tree-like format, like mytree .
e. mytime cmd[arguments]--like mytime sleep 10
f. mymtimes [dir]--like mymtimes 
g. mytimeout snds cmd[cmd-args]--like mytimeout 2 sleep 10

P.S: you can terminate the shell forcely by EOF(control+D)

2.external commands:
you can execute external commands like: cat,env,sleep and so on

3. redirect command:
input redirect: like cat<myls.c
output redirecr like ls>ls_result
input and output redirect like: cat<test>test2

4.pipe command:
my shell only support 2 or 3 commands in pipe.
for 2 commands: ps -ef|more
for 3 commands: cat myls.c| head -5 | tail 2



Disadvantage/Limitations:
1.pipe only support at most 3 commands in each time.
2.pipe and redirect only support the external command, it doesn't support mytree, mytimes and so on the build in function.
P.S. : in most case, function of pipe is fine, but sometime it will occur error. When it happens, please restart the shell.
